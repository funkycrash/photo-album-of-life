  Aspen Lodge is a unique, eco-friendly classroom nestled in the forest on the
  Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School (STS) country campus. The project brief was to
  design a classroom facility with an intimate connection to the outdoors,
  offering a completely different feel to the other spaces within the school.
  The goal was enhancing the integrated learning approach at the core of STS
  programming.
